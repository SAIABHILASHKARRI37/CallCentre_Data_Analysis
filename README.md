# Project Insights
- According to reports on March month call centre getting high count calls. So to manage these custmors centre can recruite part time employees in that month to manage calls.
- Most of calls getting 4 rating, so concentrate on those custmers to satisfy them and we can make that to 5.
- Cities(Cincinnati,Cleveland,Columbus) in this from Cincinnati we are getting less revenue, so concentrate on this city and by taking small changes we can bring more revenue from this city too.
- On weekdays like saturday and wednesday we are getting more calls. So keep more active on these days to get better results.
